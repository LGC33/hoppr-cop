# Operating System Vulnerability Reporting 

Grype and trivy will not report any operating system vulnerabilities (yum, apt, apk ect), unless a specific distribution is provided. 
This is to prevent a large number of false positives.  

This information can be provided in the SBOM as a component of type `operating-system`.  
If your SBOM is generated by newer versions of `trivy` or `syft` it should already contain this information and no further action is required.

This component will look something like this 

```json
    {
      "bom-ref": "ab16d2bb-90f7-4049-96ce-8c473ba13bd2",
      "type": "operating-system",
      "name": "rocky",
      "version": "8.7",
    }
```

If this information does not exist in your SBOM you can provide it to hoppr-cop in the following ways: 

- As a CLI argument `--os-distro`
- As an environment variable `OS_DISTROBUTION`
- by setting the class attributes on the TrivyScanner and GrypeScanner classes

Unfortunately there is not a clearly defined taxonomy for operating system.  These are some validated example values for the os-distro argument. 

- rocky:8.7
- rhel:9 
- ubuntu:22.04 
- debian:bookworm/sid
